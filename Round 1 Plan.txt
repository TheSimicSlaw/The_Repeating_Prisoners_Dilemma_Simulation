The Repeating Prisoner's Dilemma Round 1

Initial Plan:

Framework class that includes the functions:
- runSimulation takes two Strategies and runs the simulation for a fixed number of rounds
- plotSimulation takes a Simulation class and tracks the given Responses, being updated each round and then passed to the Strategies for them to submit their next moves
- recordSimulation creates a file holding the results of a given simulation

Strategy abstract class:
- startNewSimulation makes the strategy create a new instance of a Simulation class and set that as the working simulation, then set round_num equal to zero
- initialResponse gives the first cooperate/defect Response 
- continuedRounds gives the opponent's Response from the previous round for the Strategy's tracked simulation to the Strategy and prompts it for a response

Simulation class that includes the functions
- constructor that takes a number of rounds
- updateSimulation takes a pair of Responses and records them
- contains: 
  - 2 vectors of Responses
  - int for numrounds

enum Response { 
  COOPERATE,
  DEFECT
};
